## Introductory Exercise:

Montage is a way of putting images together that incorporates juxtaposition, contrast, rhythm and story. It creates a through-line by assembling, overlaying and overlapping different materials collected from different sources.
The theater can use these techniques by substituting physical movement for camera movement and editing. How can you create a close-up or pan or jump-cut without the use of a camera? How can you put together disparate materials into a whole, using the techniques of montage? 

#### Exercise 1: Working with a partner in a breakout room, create a Montage of 5 different images that convey a story.
Five shots or takes, each one a maximum of fifteen seconds long, separated by blackouts, during which those in the audience close their eyes. The director can say, for example, "Lights out," and the audience members will close their eyes, and, "Lights up," and the audience members will open their eyes.
- 5 images that use the frame of Zoom as a proscenium theater
- Think about the 5 images that create a story through juxtaposition. Think about a beginning middle and end. 
- No spoken text
- Consider how you can use the space, the light, the framing of the camera.
- Think about staging an *expresssion* or  than a description. An expression is what it feels like through a subjective lens. A description is an attempt to be as objective as possible.

Parameters:
- Meet partner in the breakout room. Storyboard for 2 minutes. Break out room to work in for 10 minutes.
- Video on / off or call out "lights up / lights down" : 

## Advice for Work Together
- Work physically. Do not waste time describing the psychology or meaning of the incident to the actors. Instead, speak with brevity and give physical instructions, such as: "Enter through the door quickly, take five steps, look to the right, exhale, look back slowly while drawing out the word, 'Fire!' in a whisper," Direct from a physical rather than a psychological point of view. 

- Take responsibility for the actor. Work with care, kindness, and precision. Take care of the actor's safety and wellbeing.
- Take responsibility for the audience. Do not assume that the audience will know what to do, or what will happen next. Be sensitive to the audience's mood, and take responsibility for the audience's experience of time and duration during the composition. Make sure that the blackouts are not too long. 



## Composition Exercise:

This is exercise is based off Anne Bogart's composition exercise. Each pair will direct the other in a solo performance. So you will each have an opportunity to be a performer and a director. 

#### Project Parameters 
- Minimum of 4 minutes, Maximum of 7 minutes. 
(All compositions must include all elements, in no particular order):
- a repeated phrase, gesture or motif
- a brilliant use of metonymy
- One piece of music with no lyrics
- A dramatic contrast in lighting
- a well excetued use of depth or perspective using the Zoom camera
- a broken expectation
- A revelation of space, character or object
- a hilarious or extraordinary moment of dance
- a conscious use of color
- No more than a paragraph of text, with the suggestion that the less text the better.
- 

### Suggested Structure of events: Loss / reunion
- The Encounter
- Loss
- Something happens
- reunion

#### This Zoom room is always open, along with breakout rooms. Please schedule a time to meet with your partner and rehearse. The performances should be repeatable and well-rehearsed. 
- Partners should take care of themselves and each other. Don't do anything unsafe. Don't lose sleep over this assignment, or make unreasonable demands of your partner or yourself.
