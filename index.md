## Introductory Exercise:
Montage is a way of putting images together that incorporates juxtaposition, contrast, rhythm and story. It creates a through-line by assembling, overlaying and overlapping different materials collected from different sources.
The theater can use these techniques, substituting physical movement for camera movement and editing. How can you create a close-up or pan or jump-cut without the use of a camera? How can you put together disparate materials into a whole, using the techniques of montage? 
Montage of 3 different images that silently convey a story.

- 3 images that use the frame of Zoom as a proscenium
- Think about the 3 images that create a story through juxtaposition. Think about a beginning middle and end. 
- Meet partner in the breakout room. Storyboard for 2 minutes. Break out room to work in for 10 minutes.
- Video on / off or call out "lights up / lights down"
